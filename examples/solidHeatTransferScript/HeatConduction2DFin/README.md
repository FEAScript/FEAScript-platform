## Heat Conduction in a Two-Dimensional Fin (Visual Editor)

This example demonstrates solving a steady-state heat transfer problem in a 2D rectangular domain using the FEAScript-platform visual editor. The problem represents a typical cooling fin scenario, where heat conduction is modeled to understand temperature distribution under specific boundary conditions.

### Using the Example

This example is provided as an XML file (`HeatConduction2DFin.xml`) which can be directly loaded into the [FEAScript-platform](https://platform.feascript.com) visual editor:

1. Visit the [FEAScript-platform](https://platform.feascript.com) in your browser
2. Click the "Load Project" button in the Control Panel
3. Select the `HeatConduction2DFin.xml` file from your computer
4. The blocks will be loaded into the editor, showing the complete simulation setup
5. Click "Evaluate" in the Control Panel to run the simulation
6. The results (temperature contour plot) will be displayed in the 'Solution' tab
