## Heat Conduction in a Two-Dimensional Fin (Visual Editor)

This example demonstrates solving a steady-state heat transfer problem in a 2D rectangular domain using the FEAScript-platform visual editor. The problem represents a typical cooling fin scenario, where heat conduction is modeled to understand temperature distribution under specific boundary conditions.

### Available Versions

1. **Standard Version** (`HeatConduction2DFin.xml`)
