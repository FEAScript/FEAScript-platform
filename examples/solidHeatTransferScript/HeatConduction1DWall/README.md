## Heat Conduction Through a Wall (Visual Editor)

This example demonstrates solving a steady-state heat transfer problem in a 1D domain using the FEAScript-platform visual editor. The problem represents heat flow through a building wall, where heat conduction is modeled to determine temperature profiles under specific boundary conditions.

### Available Versions

1. **Standard Version** (`HeatConduction1DWall.xml`)

### Instructions

The provided XML file can be directly loaded into the [FEAScript-platform](https://platform.feascript.com) visual editor. The mesh configuration and boundary conditions are defined as visual blocks.
